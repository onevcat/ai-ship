Before this, whenever I built a project I always had a clear audience in mind: users are people, readers are people, developers are people. How features are designed, how docs are written, how releases are made—all of it defaults to “how people use it.”

Recently I built a small project: [TransCrab](https://transcrab.onev.cat). It’s the first time I’ve seriously switched the “first user” from a person to an agent—specifically, OpenClaw.

What humans need to do is compressed to the bare minimum: tell OpenClaw there’s a project here, what result I want, and that I agree to let it install and run things. The rest—from setup, configuration, to getting the workflow truly running—can largely be handed off to it. Even wilder (and more fun): TransCrab itself was “written” by OpenClaw from start to finish—with me sitting in a chat app, steering the direction and making the calls.

This was a very new experience for me: for the first time I clearly felt I wasn’t building a “tool for people,” but a “capability for an agent.” It reads docs, runs scripts, makes decisions, maintains itself, and can even push an entire deployment through to production from a cold start—while I’m mostly watching, confirming, and correcting the direction.

If you push this experience one step further, something even more interesting appears: maybe before long, “building a project” itself will look more like collaboration—humans spell out intent and boundaries, agents carry execution and maintenance; agents may even prepare capability packages for other agents so they can negotiate and integrate on their own, and eventually build and run a system together long term. Humans become the people who state the wishes, rather than the ones tightening every single screw by hand.

TransCrab is just a small exploration, but it let me truly glimpse a future for the first time: more and more software will be written for agents, and agents will increasingly write software for humans. Thinking about that, I’m actually a bit excited—this path has only just begun.
